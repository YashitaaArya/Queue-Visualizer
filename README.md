# Queue Visualizer
The Queue Visualizer is an interactive desktop application built using C++ and the Qt framework, designed to help users understand the internal operations of a queue data structure.
It visually simulates how a queue works by allowing users to perform operations like:
- Enqueue (Insert): Adds an element to the rear of the queue.
- Dequeue (Remove): Removes an element from the front of the queue.
- Peek: Displays the front element of the queue.
- Clear: Empties the entire queue.
The application shows the queue growing from left to right, updating the visual layout with each operation. It highlights the Front and Rear positions, clearly indicating the current state of the queue.


### This project helps learners:
- Grasp FIFO (First-In-First-Out) behavior.
- Understand real-time updates of abstract data structures.
- Gain hands-on experience with GUI development in C++ using Qt Creator.
